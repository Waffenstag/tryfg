“I was in the discord when the "creator" dropped in to talk to us. They were aggressively selling the "it's just a band, stop wasting your time". But their claims were bullshit

First, the ZIP file we found through the videos contained more than just music from that band. There were files that obviously contained hidden data of some kind, like a set of PNG files where one was 10x the size of the others despite being identical in dimensions and quality.

Second, it wasn't a real band. The only album is from 2006, and it's actually just a side project (if you can call it that) from a band called St. Ama.”
